## Description
Users must register to create an account with a blog. They can customize their blog name and description and also add entries to their blog, edit previous entries, and delete entries. Users can also view and follow other users' blogs. If a user is looking for a specific blog entry, they can also search all entries on the website.

Riidordie was implemented using a Flask backend framework running on Python 3, with SQLite 3 used to store data and Jinja 2 used to serve templates. The frontend was created with only HTML and CSS.
