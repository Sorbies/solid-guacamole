 guac -- 2021-1-14
  - The beginning...
  - Picked EL to be the PM 
  - Picked MT's p0
  - Picked EL's droplet
  - Registered group in the form 
  - Installed apache onto droplet by following https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-20-04
  - Generated generic apache success landing page
  - Linked submodule to RoH

guac -- 2021-1-16
  - formed a repl to house our edits
  - began refactoring MT's p0 by following https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/layout/, got up to blueprints
  - researched blueprints, decorators, args, kwargs, etc.
  - picked Foundation to be our FEF
  - set up a basic flask app that worked on apache
  - configured wsgi and conf folders for apache on the droplet
  - BUG: cannot get p0 to work on apache, error "Address already in use"

ishitaG, ianC -- 2021-1-17
  - refactored login/register/blog/home routes into blueprints

ericL -- 2021-1-17
  - changed droplet firewall configs to fix an ssh connection timing out error, added IG and IAC to ssh perms for droplet
  - switched from working on root to joe on droplet
  - purged apache and redid all the steps to put the working basic flask app back up, since we couldn't figure out why p0 was bugging

guac -- 2021-1-19
  - came to a consensus to use IG and IAC's p0 instead of MT's p0 due to more people being familiar with it
  - set up a separate repl and repo to house alternate p0

ishitaG, ericL, michelleT -- 2021-1-19
  - tried starting over the apache setup on the droplet again, but still couldn't figure out why the p0 was bugging

ianC -- 2021-1-19
  - figured out why p0 was not working!
  - had to do with write/read/execute perms from apache's user, www-data, with the github repo folder we imported.
  - also needed to specify absolute file paths instead of relative because apache has / as working dir 

ishitaG -- 2021-1-20
  - refactored db_builder.py by organizing methods and changing method calls into dictionary calls
  - refactored app.py to match new db_builder
  - turned header.html into a base template, and edited all other templates so they extended base.hyml

ishitaG, ianC -- 2021-1-20
  - split app.py into __init__.py, blog.py, auth.py, search.py, and follow.py
  - registered blueprints and created login required wrapper
    - replaced redirecting users with wrapper
  - refactored blog.py and auth.py for the blog and authentication related routes

ericL, michelleT -- 2021-1-20
  - refactored follow.py and search.py for the follow and search related routes
 
guac -- 2021-1-21
  - began exploring foundation
  - fake grimlock?

ericL -- 2021-1-21
  - merged the alternate repl and repo into the main repl and repo
  - updated README and devlog

ishitaG, michelleT, ericL -- 2021-1-21
  - BUG: sometimes refreshing the website leads to an internal server error, 
    may be a database issue. Also the routing with login/register is a little
    wonky.
  - Installed Foundation on our local computers 

ishitaG -- 2021-1-21
  - Added CDN sheets to templates
  - Styled the registration page
  - BUG: after a while running the app let to "OCError: [Errno 98] Address already in use
  - Styling to-do: get header and form inline, remove margins

ishitaG -- 2021-1-21
  - Was able to fix bug via Ian's help (was a repl.it issue)
  - Finish to-do's from previous commit (finished styling reg page)

ericL -- 2021-1-22

    getting the search bar to span the vast majority of the bar

ishitaG -- 2021-1-22
  - Styled the home page    
    - Styled the table, added background, fixed titles on page

ishitaG, ianC, michelleT -- 2021-1-26
  - Fixed random apache deployment error, somehow www-data lost perms to edit database. Maybe perms got reset when we git pulled on droplet?

ishitaG, ericL, ianC -- 2021-1-26

  - Moved log out button to right side

ishitaG, ericL, michelleT -- 2021-1-26
