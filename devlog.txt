 guac -- 2021-1-14
  - The beginning...
  - Picked EL to be the PM 
  - Picked MT's p0
  - Picked EL's droplet
  - Registered group in the form 
  - Installed apache onto droplet by following https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-20-04
  - Generated generic apache success landing page
  - Linked submodule to RoH

guac -- 2021-1-16
  - formed a repl to house our edits
  - began refactoring MT's p0 by following https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/layout/, got up to blueprints
  - researched blueprints, decorators, args, kwargs, etc.
  - picked Foundation to be our FEF
  - set up a basic flask app that worked on apache
  - configured wsgi and conf folders for apache on the droplet
  - BUG: cannot get p0 to work on apache, error "Address already in use"

ishitaG, ianC -- 2021-1-17
  - Created __innit_.py and configured the app, adding blueprints
  - Refactored login/register/blog/home routes into blueprints

ericL -- 2021-1-17
  - changed droplet firewall configs to fix an ssh connection timing out error, added IG and IAC to ssh perms for droplet
  - switched from working on root to joe on droplet
  - purged apache and redid all the steps to put the working basic flask app back up

guac -- 2021-1-19
  - came to a consensus to use IG and IAC's p0 instead of MT's p0 due to more people being familiar with it
  - set up a separate repl and repo to house alternate p0

ishitaG, ericL, michelleT -- 2021-1-19
  - tried starting over the apache setup on the droplet again, but still couldn't figure out why the p0 was bugging

ianC -- 2021-1-19
  - figured out why p0 was not working!
  - had to do with write/read/execute perms from apache's user, www-data, with the github repo folder we imported.
  - also needed to specify absolute file paths instead of relative because apache has / as working dir 

ishitaG -- 2021-1-20
  - refactored db_builder.py by organizing methods and changing method calls into dictionary calls
  - refactored app.py to match new db_builder
  - turned header.html into a base template with a nav bar and {%blocks%}, and edited all other templates so they extended base.html

ishitaG, ianC -- 2021-1-20
  - split app.py into __init__.py, blog.py, auth.py, search.py, and follow.py
  - registered blueprints and created login required wrapper
    - replaced redirecting users with wrapper
  - refactored blog.py and auth.py for the blog and authentication related routes
  - modified html templates so that the urls were not hardcoded but received via the method wrappers 
    - prevents the application from crashing if a route is modified

ericL, michelleT -- 2021-1-20
  - refactored follow.py and search.py for the follow and search related routes
 
guac -- 2021-1-21

  - updated README and devlog

ishitaG, michelleT, ericL -- 2021-1-21

    may be a database issue. Also the routing with login/register is a little
    wonky.

ishitaG, ianC, michelleT -- 2021-1-26
